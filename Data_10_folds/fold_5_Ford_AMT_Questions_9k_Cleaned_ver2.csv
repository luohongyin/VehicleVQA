It's called Pro Trailer Backup Assist.
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.590
Let me tell you about it.
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Whether you're backing
a trailer into a job site or
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.930
launching a boat, if you can turn a knob,
you can now back up your trailer with ease.
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.630
Which means, whichever direction
you want your trailer to go,
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.640
just turn the knob in that direction and
the system will take over the steering,
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.770
instead of having to turn the wheel
in the opposite direction.
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.150
To use it, press the center button on
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist knob.
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660
A list of available trailers will appear.
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.840

use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,
when you want the rear of the trailer to

go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
You should also make it a habit
to use your side view mirrors

as your primary visual aid
while maneuvering the trailer.

Once the trailer is moving in
the direction you want, release the knob.

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and

braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766

generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.

And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and

If no, BLIS turns off.
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
If yes, you'll be asked if the trailer is
less than nine feet wide and 33 feet long.
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720
Now, enter length of trailer,
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.890
which is the length of the hitch
bulb to the end of the trailer.
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.230
You do so by toggling up or down,
using the menu buttons to increase or

For example, if the actual measured length
is 25 feet, input the length to 27 feet.

Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer: Low,
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.190
which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.

Let me explain, adaptive steering with
tow/haul mode, changes the ratio between
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.630
turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.520

of the steering wheel,

steps from the rear of the vehicle.

lift it to its locked position.
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.725

things to help with the set up.

which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030

go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out

the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.

Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.

which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815

then need to select a trailer type.

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766
and are less suitable in colder temps and
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.755
generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.601
snow traction rating and
are not recommended for
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.870
cold weather below 45 degrees or
snowy and icy driving conditions.
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.540
As a matter of fact,
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.230
driving on summer tires in below
freezing conditions can damage them.
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.590

First, keep in mind that
convertible top fabric
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.710
does not promote mildew growth itself.
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.705
Mildew may develop on dirt or
other foreign substances if not removed.
00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.090
So keeping the fabric clean through
regular washings will enhance the life and
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.696
beauty of the top material.
00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:29.595
When washing vehicles
with cloth top roofs.
00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.012

be sure to use a non detergent soap.

More specifically horse hair or
soft nylon.
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.950
Do not use stiff bristle brushes or
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.420
any abrasive materials or
cleaners as they can damage the fabric.

Allow the top to air dry completely
before folding it otherwise, mold or

mildew may develop and
discolor the cloth material.

It's called Sport Mode,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.140
the transmission extends the duration
between shifts of the lower gears.
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.170
So the engine stays in the sweet spot
of the engine's RPM power band for

a more spirited throttle response.
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.350

the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver

turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,

Auto Start Stop will not shut
your engine off at every stop if
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.510
the engine is still warming up,
if the outside temperature is too hot or

too cold, or if the heat and
air conditioning is in high use.

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or

drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.

go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.

braking, like if you have a larger,

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.

They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.

But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081

the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149
expand across the passengers' bodies to
distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551

the risk of injury.

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766
and are less suitable in colder temps and
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.755
generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.601
snow traction rating and
are not recommended for
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.870
cold weather below 45 degrees or
snowy and icy driving conditions.
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.540
As a matter of fact,
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.230
driving on summer tires in below

To help avoid damaging
your transmission and
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.691
to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify
a clutch warranty claim.

&gt;&gt; Is there any way to reduce
the sway from my trailer?
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.510
&gt;&gt; For those of you who like to tow,
Ford has something that can help reduce
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.330
how much your trailer sways
while you are driving.
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.180
Here's how it works.
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.060
If your trailer starts to sway, you'll see
the stability control light flash, and
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.150
a trailer sway reduce speed message

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.380
The trailer sway controller feature
will begin to apply the brakes to

reduce your engine power if needed.
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.800
If this happens, it's likely that
your trailer is improperly loaded, or
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.620
the speed of your vehicle and
trailer are too high.
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.960
Slow down, pull your vehicle off the road,
and make sure that
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.270
your trailer is connected correctly and
your load is distributed properly.
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250
Then drive at a slower speed than
you were before the sway occurred.
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.300
And here's something
else you need to know.
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.173

Let me explain, adaptive steering with
tow/haul mode, changes the ratio between
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.630
turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.520
with fewer rotations
of the steering wheel,
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.980

low speed maneuvers like parking.

When traveling at higher speeds,
on a highway for
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500

optimizes the steering response,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.630
turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.520
with fewer rotations
of the steering wheel,
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.980
which is helpful when performing
low speed maneuvers like parking.
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.280
When traveling at higher speeds,
on a highway for
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500
instance, this feature further
optimizes the steering response,
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.235
enabling the vehicle to react more
precisely to driver input and
00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.065

So instead of constant up and

If a collision risk with the vehicle or

it provides a warning to the driver.

will illuminate on your windshield.

If you do not reactive and continue
to get closer to the pedestrians or

precharges the brakes and if needed,
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.050
