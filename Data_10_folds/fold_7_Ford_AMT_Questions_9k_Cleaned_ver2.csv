Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766

generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and

are not recommended for

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.222
They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.254
But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081
To fasten it, just grab the tongue, that's
the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149
expand across the passengers' bodies to
distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551

the risk of injury.

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.960
For best results, it's recommended to use
a draw bar with the appropriate rise or

the ground. Then line up your vehicle and

to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify
a clutch warranty claim.

Did you know that your vehicle can
sense when something is behind you?

If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454

uses sensors on the rear bumpers and

a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.392

Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer: Low,
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.190
which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.

the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver

turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,

of the steering wheel,

&gt;&gt; Is there any way to reduce
the sway from my trailer?

&gt;&gt; For those of you who like to tow,
Ford has something that can help reduce
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.330
how much your trailer sways
while you are driving.

Here's how it works.

reduce your engine power if needed.

If this happens, it's likely that
your trailer is improperly loaded, or
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.620
the speed of your vehicle and
trailer are too high.
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.960
Slow down, pull your vehicle off the road,
and make sure that
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.270
your trailer is connected correctly and
your load is distributed properly.
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250
Then drive at a slower speed than
you were before the sway occurred.
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.300
And here's something
else you need to know.
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.173

If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454
spot or garage, the reverse sensing
uses sensors on the rear bumpers and

a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.392

parallel parking since your front bumper

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver

turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,

of the steering wheel,

It works a lot like
standard cruise control,
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.196
in that it still maintains
your speed on flat roadways.
00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:21.470
But with ECO Cruise,
when you tap the brake, and
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.410
then want to resume your previously set
speed, it accelerates gradually to get
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.100
your vehicle back up to speed and
that can help save energy.
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.160
Be aware that you may experience some
speed loss when first going up hill but
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.110
after a short period of time,
it will catch up to your set speed.
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380
And if equipped with
adaptive cruise control,
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.320
when your vehicle speed is slowed, it will
automatically accelerate again gradually
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.890
once traffic is cleared. That gradual
acceleration may make it seem as if your
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.930
vehicle isn't keeping up with
the speed you've set, it is.
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.710

Find the release on top of the seat
back you want to fold down.

Then, just push or pull up to release
the seat back and fold it down.

Do the same thing on the other side
if you want to fold them both down.

You'll get a full pass through
from the trunk that way.

And for your convenience, the 2013 Fusion
Hybrid battery has been moved to the floor

of the trunk, so
it won't block the pass through.
00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:47.900
And there's a clip that holds
your safety belts in place, so
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.305
they won't get caught behind
when folding your seat back.

Now, let me show you how it works.
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.420
The LATCH system consists of three
anchor points to secure your child seat.
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.850
The two lower anchors in the seat bite,
where the back and the seat cushion meet.
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.860
And the top tether anchor on the back
of or behind the vehicle seat, here.
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.110
Attach the metal connectors on
the bottom of your child seat, remember,
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.320
the ones that are either rigid or
on a strap, to the anchors,
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.350
which may be marked with
a child seat symbol, here.
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.870
If your seat has straps,
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.060
tighten them by pulling up until
the seat is secure and doesn't move.
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.780
If your clips are on a rigid attachment,
push your seat back and
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.270
forth after you've attached it,
to make sure it doesn't move.
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.190
Once you've installed your child seat with
the lower anchors of the latch system,
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.910
attach the top tether strap under the head

Let me explain.
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.450
Our quad beam LED head lamps
generate a brighter light,
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.160
that resembles natural daylight,
which in turn can help reduce eye strain.
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.425
Plus, they typically
last longer than halogen.
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:25.631
Bright LED tail lamps and
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:30.130

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and

braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.

generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.

summer tires do not have a mud and

are not recommended for

Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer: Low,
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.190
which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.346
And since automatic features are only
available with conventional trailers
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:41.288

trailer setup is required.

your conventional trailer, or

if you have a Fifth wheel or
Gooseneck trailer,
00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:49.985

use the five way switch on your steering
wheel and select type of trailer.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.920

Next, you'll be asked if you want
to set up BLIS with a trailer.
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.010
If no, BLIS turns off.
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
If yes, you'll be asked if the trailer is
less than nine feet wide and 33 feet long.
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720
Now, enter length of trailer,
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.890
which is the length of the hitch
bulb to the end of the trailer.
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.230
You do so by toggling up or down,
using the menu buttons to increase or
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.560
decrease the measurement by three feet.
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.790
You'll need to select
the length that is equal to or
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.070
greater than three feet of the actual
trailer to allow for full coverage.
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.240
For example, if the actual measured length
is 25 feet, input the length to 27 feet.
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.290
Once the length has been entered,
the setup is saved.
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.570
If the trailer has been connected but
no information for
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.890
that trailer has been entered, the system
will ask for trailer information.
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.250
If no trailer information is entered, BLIS
and cross-traffic alert will be disabled.

It's important to remember that if you
select a trailer in the display screen
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.790
prior to connecting the trailer, the
system will load that configuration, and
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.560
you'll get a message in the instrument

Here are a few things you should know.
00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:55.670
Auto Start Stop will not shut
your engine off at every stop if
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.510
the engine is still warming up,
if the outside temperature is too hot or
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.710
too cold, or if the heat and
air conditioning is in high use.
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.750
So if your AC's on because it's hot
outside, your engine may keep running.
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.490
It may also restart while stopped
to maintain interior comfort or
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.420
to recharge the battery.
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.680
Also, if you're towing a trailer or

again once you disable those features.
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.590
You can also use the five-way switch

Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer: Low,
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.190
which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.
