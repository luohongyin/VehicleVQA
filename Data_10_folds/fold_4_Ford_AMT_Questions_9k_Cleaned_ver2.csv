Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766
and are less suitable in colder temps and
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.755
generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.601
snow traction rating and
are not recommended for
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.870
cold weather below 45 degrees or
snowy and icy driving conditions.
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.540
As a matter of fact,

driving on summer tires in below
freezing conditions can damage them.

Did you know that your vehicle can

If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454

uses sensors on the rear bumpers and

a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.

Whether you're backing

you can now back up your trailer with ease.

use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.

Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,

Once the trailer is moving in
the direction you want, release the knob.

small adjustments with the knob to

keep the trailer moving
along the desired path.

Did you know your vehicle may be equipped
with a convenient feature that helps make
00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.070
maneuvering a trailer in reverse easy?
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.320
It's called Pro Trailer Backup Assist.
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.590
Let me tell you about it.
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Whether you're backing
a trailer into a job site or
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.930
launching a boat, if you can turn a knob,
you can now back up your trailer with ease.
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.630
Which means, whichever direction
you want your trailer to go,
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.640
just turn the knob in that direction and
the system will take over the steering,
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.770
instead of having to turn the wheel
in the opposite direction.
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.150
To use it, press the center button on
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist knob.
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660
A list of available trailers will appear.
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.840
Choose the one you want and
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.990
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
will attempt to locate it.
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.010
Once the targeting sticker is
located by the rearview camera,
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.170
the screen will prompt you to
shift into reverse to activate it.
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.450
Then follow the prompts displayed
on the information screen.
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.390
With your hands off the steering wheel,
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.820
use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,
when you want the rear of the trailer to
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.340
go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
You should also make it a habit
to use your side view mirrors
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.230
as your primary visual aid
while maneuvering the trailer.
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.190
Once the trailer is moving in
the direction you want, release the knob.
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.450
Keep in mind, you may need to make
small adjustments with the knob to
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
keep the trailer moving
along the desired path.
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.820
As soon as the knob is either released or
turned back to the center position,
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.132
the vehicle will follow
the trailer's path.

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.960
For best results, it's recommended to use
a draw bar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600
drop to position your trailer level to
the ground. Then line up your vehicle and

First, keep in mind that
convertible top fabric
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.710
does not promote mildew growth itself.
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.705
Mildew may develop on dirt or
other foreign substances if not removed.
00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.090
So keeping the fabric clean through
regular washings will enhance the life and
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.696
beauty of the top material.
00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:29.595
When washing vehicles
with cloth top roofs.
00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.012
Start by vacuuming with a soft
bristle brush attachment and
00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:35.070
be sure to use a non detergent soap.
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.925
Scrub gently in a circular pattern using
a terrycloth towel or soft bristle brush.

More specifically horse hair or
soft nylon.
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.950
Do not use stiff bristle brushes or
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.420
any abrasive materials or
cleaners as they can damage the fabric.
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.760
When finished, rinse thoroughly
removing all soap residues.
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.040
Allow the top to air dry completely
before folding it otherwise, mold or
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.340
mildew may develop and
discolor the cloth material.
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.090

use a standard clothes lint roller or

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.222
They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.254
But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081
To fasten it, just grab the tongue, that's
the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149
expand across the passengers' bodies to
distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551

Did you know your vehicle may be equipped
with a convenient feature that helps make
00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.070
maneuvering a trailer in reverse easy?
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.320
It's called Pro Trailer Backup Assist.
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.590
Let me tell you about it.
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Whether you're backing
a trailer into a job site or
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.930
launching a boat, if you can turn a knob,
you can now back up your trailer with ease.
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.630
Which means, whichever direction
you want your trailer to go,
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.640
just turn the knob in that direction and
the system will take over the steering,
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.770
instead of having to turn the wheel
in the opposite direction.
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.150
To use it, press the center button on
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist knob.
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660
A list of available trailers will appear.
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.840
Choose the one you want and
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.990
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
will attempt to locate it.
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.010
Once the targeting sticker is
located by the rearview camera,
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.170
the screen will prompt you to
shift into reverse to activate it.
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.450
Then follow the prompts displayed
on the information screen.
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.390
With your hands off the steering wheel,
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.820
use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,
when you want the rear of the trailer to
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.340
go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
You should also make it a habit
to use your side view mirrors
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.230
as your primary visual aid
while maneuvering the trailer.
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.190
Once the trailer is moving in
the direction you want, release the knob.
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.450
Keep in mind, you may need to make
small adjustments with the knob to
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
keep the trailer moving
along the desired path.
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.820
As soon as the knob is either released or
turned back to the center position,
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.132
the vehicle will follow
the trailer's path.
00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:28.660

Did you know that your vehicle can
sense when something is behind you?

If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454
spot or garage, the reverse sensing
uses sensors on the rear bumpers and
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.804
a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.392
This is really helpful when you're
parallel parking since your front bumper
00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:34.669

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902

superior traction, cornering, and

braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766

generally wear faster

summer tires do not have a mud and

Let me explain, adaptive steering with
tow/haul mode, changes the ratio between
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver

turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,

of the steering wheel,

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766
and are less suitable in colder temps and
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.755
generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.601
snow traction rating and
are not recommended for
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.870
cold weather below 45 degrees or
snowy and icy driving conditions.
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.540
As a matter of fact,
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.230
driving on summer tires in below
freezing conditions can damage them.
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.590
