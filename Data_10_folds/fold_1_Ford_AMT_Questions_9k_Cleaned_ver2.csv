Did you know that your vehicle can
sense when something is behind you?
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.020
It can, thanks to an available
reverse sensing system.
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.940
Let me show you how it works.
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.397
If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454
spot or garage, the reverse sensing
uses sensors on the rear bumpers and
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.804
a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.392
This is really helpful when you're
parallel parking since your front bumper
00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:34.669
swings when you're backing up.
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.614
[MUSIC]
00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.960
And one more thing, the sensors have to be
clear of snow, ice, or mud to work right.
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.220
So make sure to check them periodically
and be aware that outside conditions or
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.690
noises may also trigger the system.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.860
The Alert mode lets you know if
you're drifting out of your lane.
00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:24.740
Using three short vibrations, it warns you
to steer your vehicle back into your lane.
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.180
If you want to change the strength
of the vibration your car gives you,
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.245
you can adjust the intensity
setting in the message center.
00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.680
Lane-keeping will remember
the changes you make, so
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.640
you won't have to reset it the next
time you turn on the system.",http://people.csail.mit.edu/rishabhy/split_videos/Lane Keeping System _ Ford How-To _ Ford-2K62ZvQis4I_seg2.mp4,How does the Alert System work?

To set the blind spot
detection on a trailer,
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.000
use the five way switch on your steering
wheel and select type of trailer.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.920

conventional-type trailers.

Next, you'll be asked if you want
to set up BLIS with a trailer.
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.010
If no, BLIS turns off.
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
If yes, you'll be asked if the trailer is
less than nine feet wide and 33 feet long.
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720
Now, enter length of trailer,
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.890
which is the length of the hitch
bulb to the end of the trailer.
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.230
You do so by toggling up or down,
using the menu buttons to increase or
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.560
decrease the measurement by three feet.
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.790
You'll need to select
the length that is equal to or
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.070
greater than three feet of the actual
trailer to allow for full coverage.
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.240
For example, if the actual measured length
is 25 feet, input the length to 27 feet.
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.290
Once the length has been entered,
the setup is saved.

If the trailer has been connected but
no information for

will ask for trailer information.

It's important to remember that if you
select a trailer in the display screen

your safety belts in place, so

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.222
They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.254
But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081
To fasten it, just grab the tongue, that's
the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149
expand across the passengers' bodies to
distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551

the risk of injury.

To maintain the appearance of

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.620
regular cleaning is highly recommended.
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.440
To clean, use water and a mild liquid
automotive soap from an auto supply store.
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.590
Or a 50/50 solution of water and
white vinegar also works well.
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.411
And remove all excess water as hard water
spots can deposit iron which can lead

it's recommended to use
an oil-based bug and tar remover.

In extreme winter climates, be sure
to rinse away salt residue as soon as
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.070

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766
and are less suitable in colder temps and

generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and

are not recommended for

Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer: Low,
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.190
which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.346
And since automatic features are only
available with conventional trailers
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:41.288
within trailer reverse guidance,
trailer setup is required.
00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:44.288
If you choose not to set up
your conventional trailer, or
00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.787
if you have a Fifth wheel or
Gooseneck trailer,
00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:49.985

drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.

Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.

arrow to advance to the next letter.

If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,

which I'll tell you about later.

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or

drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.

go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.

arrows of the five-way controls, spell out

If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,

you can now back up your trailer with ease.

Which means, whichever direction
you want your trailer to go,

just turn the knob in that direction and
the system will take over the steering,

use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,
when you want the rear of the trailer to

go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.

the direction you want, release the knob.

small adjustments with the knob to

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.960
For best results, it's recommended to use
a draw bar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600
drop to position your trailer level to
the ground. Then line up your vehicle and
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360
trailer by pulling forward, so
they're in line with one another.
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.994
Second, from inside the vehicle
to begin programming,
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:56.797
press the center of the Pro Trailer Backup
Assist button located to the right of
00:00:56.797 --> 00:00:58.569

the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:08.489
Press OK once finished.
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:11.508
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:16.095
Electric, which is the default or
surge type and press OK.
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.751
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer.
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.737
Low, which is the recommended setting for
most trailers,
00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:25.892

more aggressive braking like if you have
00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:29.230
a larger, heavier trailer, for instance.

If this happens, it's likely that
your trailer is improperly loaded, or

the speed of your vehicle and
trailer are too high.

your trailer is connected correctly and
your load is distributed properly.
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250
Then drive at a slower speed than
you were before the sway occurred.

And here's something
else you need to know.
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.173

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:08.489
Press OK once finished.
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:11.508
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:16.095

But with ECO Cruise,
when you tap the brake, and
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.410
then want to resume your previously set
speed, it accelerates gradually to get
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.100
your vehicle back up to speed and
that can help save energy.

Be aware that you may experience some
speed loss when first going up hill but
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.110
after a short period of time,
it will catch up to your set speed.

And if equipped with
adaptive cruise control,
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.320
when your vehicle speed is slowed, it will
automatically accelerate again gradually

acceleration may make it seem as if your

To help avoid damaging
your transmission and
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.691
to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify
a clutch warranty claim.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:06.620
To help avoid damaging
your transmission and
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.691
to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify
a clutch warranty claim.

Did you know that your vehicle can
sense when something is behind you?

It can, thanks to an available
reverse sensing system.

Let me show you how it works.
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.397
If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454
spot or garage, the reverse sensing
uses sensors on the rear bumpers and
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.804
a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.392
This is really helpful when you're
parallel parking since your front bumper
00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:34.669
swings when you're backing up.
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.614
[MUSIC]
00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.960
And one more thing, the sensors have to be
clear of snow, ice, or mud to work right.
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.220
So make sure to check them periodically
and be aware that outside conditions or
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.690
noises may also trigger the system.

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.222
They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.254
But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081
To fasten it, just grab the tongue, that's
the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149
expand across the passengers' bodies to
distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766

generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.

And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and

are not recommended for

00:00:07.204 --> 00:00:11.430
a feature to enhance its performance when
driven on hilly and mountainous roads.
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.750
Let me explain.
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.200
It's called Sport Mode,
and when activated,
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.140
the transmission extends the duration
between shifts of the lower gears.
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.170
So the engine stays in the sweet spot
of the engine's RPM power band for
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.580
a more spirited throttle response.
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.350
So instead of constant up and
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.420
down gear shifts, the transmission
holds a specific gear longer for
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.720
peak performance when driving on twisty,
rolling roads with a steep grade.",http://people.csail.mit.edu/rishabhy/split_videos/Using Sport Mode - Ford Trucks _ Ford How-To _ Ford-rYZKTkmXyro_seg1.mp4,How can my cars preform better on twisting or hilly roads?

Let me explain, adaptive steering with
tow/haul mode, changes the ratio between
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.630
turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.520
with fewer rotations
of the steering wheel,
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.980
which is helpful when performing
low speed maneuvers like parking.
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.280
When traveling at higher speeds,
on a highway for
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500
instance, this feature further
optimizes the steering response,
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.235
enabling the vehicle to react more
precisely to driver input and
00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.065

Auto Start Stop will not shut

if the outside temperature is too hot or

too cold, or if the heat and
air conditioning is in high use.
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.750
So if your AC's on because it's hot
outside, your engine may keep running.
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.490
It may also restart while stopped

tighten them by pulling up until
the seat is secure and doesn't move.
