00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver

turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,

regular cleaning is highly recommended.
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.440
To clean, use water and a mild liquid
automotive soap from an auto supply store.

Or a 50/50 solution of water and
white vinegar also works well.
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.411
And remove all excess water as hard water
spots can deposit iron which can lead

it's recommended to use
an oil-based bug and tar remover.

In extreme winter climates, be sure
to rinse away salt residue as soon as

to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify
a clutch warranty claim.

Your vehicle has a capless fuel filler
that saves time at the pump and
00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:09.680
keeps your hands cleaner.
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.010
There's no cap to twist off and
it's simple to use.
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.510
Just open your fuel door by either
putting a finger under the exposed tab
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.530
on the door.
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.800
Or by pushing it in a bit
until it releases and
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.470
you can open it the rest of the way.
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.440
Insert the nozzle all the way,
making sure it goes through both flaps.
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.290
Fill up, then wait five seconds
before removing the nozzle and
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.780
close the fuel door.
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.840
If you're using a portable fuel container,
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.160
you'll need to use the easy fuel funnel
provided with your vehicle to avoid
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.470
damaging the seals on
the spring loaded flaps.
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.720
And one more thing, to help protect
against fuel theft, splashing, or
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.770
water getting in the tank, the capless
fuel filler is tamper resistant.
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.440
And the self closing, spring loaded flaps
help keep fuel from sloshing out and
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.550
water from leaking in when it rains or
when you wash your vehicle.

To help avoid damaging

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.691
to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify

go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.

&gt;&gt; Is there any way to reduce
the sway from my trailer?
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.510
&gt;&gt; For those of you who like to tow,
Ford has something that can help reduce
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.330
how much your trailer sways
while you are driving.
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.180
Here's how it works.
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.060
If your trailer starts to sway, you'll see
the stability control light flash, and
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.150
a trailer sway reduce speed message
in your information display.

The trailer sway controller feature
will begin to apply the brakes to
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.210
individual wheels, and
reduce your engine power if needed.
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.800
If this happens, it's likely that
your trailer is improperly loaded, or
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.620
the speed of your vehicle and
trailer are too high.
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.960
Slow down, pull your vehicle off the road,
and make sure that
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.270
your trailer is connected correctly and
your load is distributed properly.
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250
Then drive at a slower speed than
you were before the sway occurred.
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.300
And here's something
else you need to know.
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.173
Trailer sway control will not affect how

Let me explain, adaptive steering with
tow/haul mode, changes the ratio between
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver

turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.520

of the steering wheel,

Auto Start Stop will not shut
your engine off at every stop if
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.510
the engine is still warming up,
if the outside temperature is too hot or
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.710
too cold, or if the heat and
air conditioning is in high use.
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.750
So if your AC's on because it's hot
outside, your engine may keep running.
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.490
It may also restart while stopped
to maintain interior comfort or
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.680
Also, if you're towing a trailer or

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766
and are less suitable in colder temps and
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.755
generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646
And unlike all-season tires,
summer tires do not have a mud and
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.601

are not recommended for
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.870

snowy and icy driving conditions.

driving on summer tires in below
freezing conditions can damage them.

To help avoid damaging
your transmission and
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.691
to help provide a better
driving experience,
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.640
there are a few things you should know
about proper clutch pedal operation.
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.215
Let me explain.
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.445
The manual transmission in your vehicle
has six gears along with a reverse gear.
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.265
When starting your vehicle, make sure that
your clutch pedal is fully depressed.
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.575
In order for your transmission and
clutch to function at it's best,
00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.520
you need to press the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor before every shift.
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Then slowly release it while
pressing the accelerator.
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.280
Not pressing the clutch pedal fully
between shifts can damage your
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.780
transmission, and you may experience
a grinding sound, rapid jerking motion,
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.400
or the car may stall if the clutch
is not properly engaged.
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080
And here's another thing you should know.
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
Don't drive with your foot
resting on the clutch pedal, or
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.230
use it to hold your vehicle at
a standstill while waiting on a hill.
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670
Doing so may overheat the clutch and
prematurely wear it out.
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.548
This could nullify
a clutch warranty claim.

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.222
They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.254
But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081

the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.

If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149

distribute the forces from the crash over

To set the blind spot
detection on a trailer,
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.000
use the five way switch on your steering
wheel and select type of trailer.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.920
Keep in mind, BLIS only supports
conventional-type trailers.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.980
Next, you'll be asked if you want
to set up BLIS with a trailer.
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.010
If no, BLIS turns off.
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
If yes, you'll be asked if the trailer is
less than nine feet wide and 33 feet long.
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720
Now, enter length of trailer,
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.890
which is the length of the hitch
bulb to the end of the trailer.
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.230
You do so by toggling up or down,
using the menu buttons to increase or
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.560
decrease the measurement by three feet.
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.790
You'll need to select
the length that is equal to or
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.070
greater than three feet of the actual
trailer to allow for full coverage.
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.240
For example, if the actual measured length
is 25 feet, input the length to 27 feet.
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.290
Once the length has been entered,
the setup is saved.
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.570
If the trailer has been connected but
no information for
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.890

will ask for trailer information.

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.

Summer tires are ideal for
performance vehicles and
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.366
do not have the same traction
characteristics of all-season tires.
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.902
As they are designed for
superior traction, cornering, and
00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.010
braking performance for
both wet and dry road conditions.
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
This is attributed to specialized tread
patterns, like less grooving, to provide
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.159
more tire contact with the road, shallower
tread depth, and softer rubber compounds.
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Keep in mind, since summer tires
are composed of softer materials,
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.360
they tend to lose flexibility.
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.766

generally wear faster
than an all-season tire.
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.646

summer tires do not have a mud and

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.020
It can, thanks to an available
reverse sensing system.
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.940
Let me show you how it works.
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.397
If your vehicle is in reverse, like when
you're backing out of or into a parking
00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.454
spot or garage, the reverse sensing
uses sensors on the rear bumpers and
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.804
a warning sound to let you know
if something's behind you.
00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.069
If you have both forward and
reverse sensing, sensors on the front and
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.450
back of your vehicle will detect
objects when you're in reverse.
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.392
This is really helpful when you're
parallel parking since your front bumper
00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:34.669
swings when you're backing up.
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.614
[MUSIC]
00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.960
And one more thing, the sensors have to be
clear of snow, ice, or mud to work right.
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.220
So make sure to check them periodically
and be aware that outside conditions or
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.690
noises may also trigger the system.
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.800

maneuvering a trailer in reverse easy?
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.320
It's called Pro Trailer Backup Assist.
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.590
Let me tell you about it.
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Whether you're backing
a trailer into a job site or
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.930
launching a boat, if you can turn a knob,
you can now back up your trailer with ease.
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.630
Which means, whichever direction
you want your trailer to go,
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.640
just turn the knob in that direction and
the system will take over the steering,
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.770
instead of having to turn the wheel
in the opposite direction.
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.150
To use it, press the center button on
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist knob.
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660
A list of available trailers will appear.
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.840
Choose the one you want and
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.990
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
will attempt to locate it.
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.010
Once the targeting sticker is
located by the rearview camera,
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.170
the screen will prompt you to
shift into reverse to activate it.
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.450
Then follow the prompts displayed
on the information screen.
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.390
With your hands off the steering wheel,
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.820
use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,
when you want the rear of the trailer to
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.340
go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
You should also make it a habit
to use your side view mirrors
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.230
as your primary visual aid
while maneuvering the trailer.
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.190
Once the trailer is moving in
the direction you want, release the knob.
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.450
Keep in mind, you may need to make
small adjustments with the knob to
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
keep the trailer moving
along the desired path.
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.820
As soon as the knob is either released or
turned back to the center position,
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.132

the trailer's path.

maneuvering a trailer in reverse easy?
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.320
It's called Pro Trailer Backup Assist.
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.590
Let me tell you about it.
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Whether you're backing
a trailer into a job site or
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.930
launching a boat, if you can turn a knob,
you can now back up your trailer with ease.
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.630
Which means, whichever direction
you want your trailer to go,
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.640
just turn the knob in that direction and
the system will take over the steering,
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.770
instead of having to turn the wheel
in the opposite direction.
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.150
To use it, press the center button on
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist knob.
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.660
A list of available trailers will appear.
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.840
Choose the one you want and
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.990
the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
will attempt to locate it.

With your hands off the steering wheel,
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.820
use the Pro Trailer Backup Assist
knob to steer the trailer.
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.730
Turn the knob left, or counter-clockwise,
when you want the rear of the trailer to
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.340
go to the left, and right,
clockwise, to go right.
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
You should also make it a habit
to use your side view mirrors
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.230
as your primary visual aid
while maneuvering the trailer.
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.190
Once the trailer is moving in
the direction you want, release the knob.
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.450
Keep in mind, you may need to make
small adjustments with the knob to
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060
keep the trailer moving
along the desired path.
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.820
As soon as the knob is either released or
turned back to the center position,
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.132

Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.

They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.

But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.

If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and

If this happens, it's likely that
your trailer is improperly loaded, or

the speed of your vehicle and
trailer are too high.

and make sure that

your trailer is connected correctly and
your load is distributed properly.
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250

you were before the sway occurred.
